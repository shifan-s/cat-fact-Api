# Catfact Api

## This is a React app that displays a random cat fact and updates the fact every 5 seconds automatically. The user can also click a "Get New Fact" button to fetch a new fact manually. The app uses Axios for fetching the data from the Cat Facts API and Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring the app is responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile screens.
